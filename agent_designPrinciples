ðŸ“Œ Build error handling first, features second
-Plan for API timeouts, malformed data, and rate limits
-Design failure paths before success paths
-Agent #7 crashed our CRM with 1,000 duplicate entries - don't be me

ðŸ“Œ Start with manual processes, then automate
-Document your manual workflow first
-Identify decision points and edge cases
-Broken processes just break faster when automated

ðŸ“Œ Think in micro-agents, not mega-workflows
-12 small agents beat 1 massive workflow
-Each agent does one thing perfectly
-Easier to debug, maintain, and reuse

ðŸ“Œ Monitor everything from day one
-Track execution times, success rates, failure points
-Agent #23 took 47 minutes for a 3-minute task
-What you don't measure becomes your bottleneck

ðŸ“Œ Context is your secret weapon
-Feed agents rich background information
-Well-informed agents make senior-level decisions
-Context turns $10/hour tasks into $100/hour value

ðŸ“Œ Test with real data, not perfect examples
-Demo data is clean, real data is messy
-Test with worst-case scenarios
-Expect incomplete and inconsistent inputs

ðŸ“Œ Version control your workflows
-Back up before every major change
-n8n makes iteration easy, rollbacks painful
-"Quick fixes" can destroy weeks of work

ðŸ“Œ Focus on high-impact, low-complexity wins first
-30 minutes daily > 3 hours weekly savings
-Build momentum with quick wins
-Tackle complex challenges after proving value

ðŸ“Œ Design for handoffs, not takeovers
-Enhance human decision-making, don't replace it
-Build review points into critical workflows

ðŸ“Œ Standardize your naming and documentation
-Use consistent naming conventions
-Document logic inline
-Future you will thank present you at 3 AM
