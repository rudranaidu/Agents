Core Idea behind building agent

Under the hood, every capable AI agent follows the same simple loop:
- Take user input and pass it to an LLM.
- Give the LLM access to tools (like APIs, databases, search).
- Run the LLM in a loop — it reasons, picks a tool, uses it, reflects.
- Break the loop once the task is done. You do this by asking the LLM to return a structured signal—like { status: "done" }.
- Build rich context by storing each user message, AI thought, tool call, and response—then pass that history back into the LLM on the next loop. That’s context engineering.

That’s it!

This core loop is how agents book flights, update CRMs, fix bugs, write emails, or spin up cloud infra. 
You don’t need a full orchestration platform to start—just a while loop, a prompt, and a few function calls.
