Different agent types in LangChain, especially:

1. ReAct Agent (Reason + Act)
2. Conversational Agent
3. Structured Agent

1. ReAct Agent (Reasoning and Acting)
  Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí repeat...
  Very flexible, suitable for tools that require iterative logic.
  Best when: LLM needs to use tools multiple times or reason step-by-step. 

‚úÖ  Use when: You need complex reasoning, tool chaining, or step-by-step breakdown.

2. üó£Ô∏è Conversational Agent
  Tracks memory and conversation context.
  Best for chatbot-like interactions with tool use.
  Can answer follow-up questions based on prior context.
  Supports AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION.

‚úÖ Use when: You want a chatbot-style agent that understands previous messages.

3. Structured Agent
  More strict input/output format.
  Uses ToolInputSchema (like you just used).
  Avoids hallucinations with structured schema validation.
  Suitable when inputs must follow a fixed format.

‚úÖ Use when: Tool inputs need validation, or you need strict structured interaction.

‚úÖ Summary of Trade-offs

| Agent Type         | Pros                                  | Cons                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ReAct**          | Great for tool chaining and reasoning | May hallucinate if not guided        |
| **Conversational** | Tracks context, good for chatbots     | Slightly more complex                |
| **Structured**     | Enforces schema, less hallucination   | Less flexible, must predefine inputs |
