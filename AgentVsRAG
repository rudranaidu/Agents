How does an Agent differ from a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chain?

| Feature          | **Agent**                                                                         | **RAG Chain**                                                                         |

| **Definition**   | A dynamic decision-maker that chooses which tools or actions to use.              | A pipeline where a query is answered by retrieving documents + generating a response. |
| **Behavior**     | Reactive and interactive — can take **multiple steps** with different tools.      | One-shot — retrieve, then generate answer in a single flow.                           |
| **Control Flow** | Uses reasoning to **decide actions at runtime**.                                  | Fixed sequence: `retrieve → read → respond`.                                          |
| **Tool Usage**   | Can use multiple tools (e.g., web search, DB queries, file I/O).                  | Typically uses only a retriever and an LLM.                                           |
| **Example**      | "Find the address in a file. If not found, Google it." → picks tools accordingly. | "What is Rudrayya’s address?" → looks in the document store and answers.              |
| **Frameworks**   | LangChain Agents, LangGraph, ReAct, Tool-Calling APIs.                            | LangChain RAG, Haystack, LlamaIndex.                                                  |
