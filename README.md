# Agents
Learning LLM agents and different agentic frameworks
Great! Thanks for the clarity. Since your goal is to **master one in-demand agentic framework in 15 days** — with **daily hands-on exercises**, and you're also targeting **interview readiness** — here's what I recommend:

---

## ✅ Recommended Framework to Master: **LangChain Agents**

### 🔥 Why LangChain Agents?

* **Industry Adoption:** Most widely adopted open-source agent framework (used in OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Cohere, and many enterprise stacks).
* **Rich ecosystem:** Tools, memory, planning, retrieval, function calling, and agent orchestration.
* **Interview Relevance:** Frequently appears in job descriptions and technical interviews for LLM/GenAI/Agent roles.
* **Strong Community + LangSmith integration** for debugging, tracing, evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Your Personalized 15-Day Learning Plan for **LangChain Agents**

### 💡 Approach:

* **Daily Time Needed**: 1.5–2.5 hours
* Each day includes:

  * 📖 *Concept*
  * 💻 *Code Walkthrough or Build*
  * 🔧 *Mini Exercise*
  * ✅ *Interview Prep Tip*

---

### 📅 Day 1: Setup + Intro to LangChain Agents

* **Concept**: What is an agent? LangChain agent vs. chain. Use cases.
* **Hands-on**: Set up Python env, install `langchain`, `openai`, `chromadb`, `langchain-experimental`, etc.
* **Mini Exercise**: Run a `zero-shot-react-agent` with 1 tool (e.g., Calculator).
* ✅ *Interview Tip*: Know difference between a "Chain" and "Agent" in LangChain.

---

### 📅 Day 2: Tools & Toolkits in LangChain

* **Concept**: What are tools in LangChain? How to wrap functions as tools.
* **Hands-on**: Write 3 tools: `get_weather`, `currency_converter`, `file_reader`
* **Mini Exercise**: Build an agent using those 3 tools.
* ✅ *Tip*: Be ready to explain what `Tool`, `ToolInputSchema`, and `tool()` decorator do.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Agent Types (ReAct, Conversational, Structured)

* **Concept**: ReAct agent vs Conversational Agent vs Structured agent.
* **Hands-on**: Run one ReAct agent and one Conversational agent.
* **Mini Exercise**: Create a conversational agent that books a mock appointment using tools.
* ✅ *Tip*: Understand when to use different agent types and trade-offs.

---

### 📅 Day 4: Agent with Vector Search (Tool + RAG)

* **Concept**: Use a vector store tool (ChromaDB) inside an agent.
* **Hands-on**: Index a few text files with ChromaDB, make it a tool.
* **Mini Exercise**: Agent that answers questions about the uploaded PDFs.
* ✅ *Tip*: Interviewers may ask: How does an agent differ from a RAG chain?

---

### 📅 Day 5: Adding Memory to Agents

* **Concept**: Short-term memory (Buffer), Long-term (VectorStoreRetrieverMemory)
* **Hands-on**: Add memory to Conversational Agent.
* **Mini Exercise**: Ask 3 queries in a row and observe memory influence.
* ✅ *Tip*: Be able to describe how memory improves task continuity.

---

### 📅 Day 6: Function Calling & OpenAI Tools

* **Concept**: How LangChain integrates OpenAI function calling.
* **Hands-on**: Create function-calling agents using `ChatOpenAI(..., tools=...)`.
* **Mini Exercise**: Define 2 tools as OpenAI function calls and use them in the agent.
* ✅ *Tip*: Know how LangChain abstracts OpenAI function calls.

---

### 📅 Day 7: Planning with LangGraph / Experimental Agent Executors

* **Concept**: Plan-and-Execute architecture in LangChain
* **Hands-on**: Try `PlanAndExecuteAgentExecutor` or `StructuredChatAgent`
* **Mini Exercise**: Plan a 3-step task with a `planner` and `executor`
* ✅ *Tip*: Know the difference between ReAct and Plan & Execute.

---

### 📅 Day 8: Debugging & Tracing with LangSmith

* **Concept**: Use LangSmith to monitor agent runs
* **Hands-on**: Enable LangSmith and view a trace for an agent query
* **Mini Exercise**: Debug a tool that fails and fix it using trace logs.
* ✅ *Tip*: Interviewers love LangSmith knowledge — explain how it helps optimization.

---

### 📅 Day 9: Multi-Tool Agents & Conditionals

* **Concept**: Build agents that use multiple tools conditionally.
* **Hands-on**: Build a utility agent that picks tools based on user query.
* **Mini Exercise**: Add logic for fallback tool in case of tool failure.
* ✅ *Tip*: Know how agents choose tools from the toolset using prompts.

---

### 📅 Day 10: Multi-Agent Setup in LangChain

* **Concept**: Create agents with different roles and let them collaborate.
* **Hands-on**: Create `Researcher`, `Writer`, `Reviewer` agents.
* **Mini Exercise**: Use a simple orchestrator to run them sequentially.
* ✅ *Tip*: Explain how you’d build a role-based system using LangChain agents.

---

### 📅 Day 11: Add External APIs & Web Search Tool

* **Concept**: Connect agents to real-time web tools
* **Hands-on**: Add SerpAPI or Tavily search tool
* **Mini Exercise**: Agent that answers current news or stock price
* ✅ *Tip*: Be ready to explain API rate-limiting and reliability in agents.

---

### 📅 Day 12: Error Handling & Robustness

* **Concept**: Tool failure recovery, retries, conditional steps
* **Hands-on**: Implement fallback mechanism in tool usage
* **Mini Exercise**: Create an agent that retries with a different tool on failure
* ✅ *Tip*: Agents are non-deterministic; explain how you’d handle unpredictability.

---

### 📅 Day 13: Agent Evaluation

* **Concept**: Trace logs, latency, success rate, hallucination metrics
* **Hands-on**: Run evaluation with LangSmith or custom prompt-based eval
* **Mini Exercise**: Track success of your tools over 5 queries
* ✅ *Tip*: Share evaluation strategy and failure analysis in interviews.

---

### 📅 Day 14: Agent Ethics & Compliance

* **Concept**: What can go wrong with autonomous agents? (e.g., PII, misuse)
* **Hands-on**: Add a compliance filter tool that checks for unsafe responses
* **Mini Exercise**: Block any query involving credit card or PII info.
* ✅ *Tip*: Be prepared to discuss how to make agents “safe by design.”

---

### 📅 Day 15: Capstone Project + Interview Readiness

* **Project Idea**: “Bug Triage Agent”
  🧰 Tools: log parser, bug fetcher, workaround suggester, memory
  🧠 Flow: Accepts error → finds similar bug → suggests JC patch + workaround
* **Deliverables**: GitHub repo, README, architecture diagram
* ✅ *Tip*: Prepare a 3-min pitch: architecture, tools used, problems solved, evaluation method.
